# **FACE DETECTION USING HAAR CASCADE**

## **Description**
This project focuses on face detection using Haar Cascade Classifiers and OpenCV. It involves detecting and highlighting human faces in images and video frames by applying machine learning techniques with pre-trained models.

### **Key Concepts:**

1. **Face Detection Overview:**
   - Identifies human faces within images or video streams.
   - Utilizes large datasets representing diverse backgrounds, genders, and cultures to ensure accuracy.

2. **OpenCV Library:**
   - An open-source computer vision library that simplifies image processing tasks.
   - Provides tools for face and object detection.

3. **Haar Cascade Classifiers:**
   - Based on the Viola-Jones algorithm for rapid object detection.
   - Utilizes cascades of classifiers to accurately detect facial features.
   - Pre-trained classifiers built into OpenCV eliminate the need for additional training.

### **Technologies Used:**
- **Python**: Programming language for implementation.
- **OpenCV**: Image processing and computer vision library.
- **Google Colab**: Used for execution in the examples.
